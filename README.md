Bayesian Analysis
================
Michael L. Thompson

## Introduction

This repository houses examples and presentations on Bayesian Analysis
that I’d like to share publicly.

For the moment, it only holds the excerpted slides from a 1-hour
presentation I gave on Nov. 17, 2020, as a guest lecturer to the
“Probability Models” graduate course in the Master of Business
Analytics program at the University of Cincinnati in the Lindner College
of Business. (Thank you for inviting me, Professor Peng Wang\!)

The excerpts focus on the newly pre-published work by Prof. Andrew
Gelman and his colleagues: [“Bayesian
Workflow”](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/Bayesian_Workflow_article.pdf).
Also, be sure to read his blog post and the comments in response on the
topic: [“Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science:
Bayesian
Workflow”](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/11/10/bayesian-workflow/).
