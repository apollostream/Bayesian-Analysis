Bayesian Analysis
================
Michael L. Thompson

## Introduction

This repository houses examples and presentations on Bayesian Analysis
that I’d like to share publicly. This adds a more active component to my
passive sharing of Bayesian content through my Flipboard e-zine mashup
[“Bayesian”](https://flipboard.com/@apollostream/bayesian-8jbdtq26z).

For the moment, it only holds an Acrobat PDF file of the excerpted
[slides from a 1-hour introductory
presentation](https://github.com/apollostream/Bayesian-Analysis/blob/main/Bayesian%20Analysis_Probability%20Models%20guest%20lecture_Thompson_excerpts.pdf)
I gave on Nov. 17, 2020, as a guest lecturer to the “Probability Models”
graduate course in the Master of Business Analytics program at the
University of Cincinnati in the Lindner College of Business. (Thank you
for inviting me, Professor Peng Wang\!)

The excerpts focus on the newly pre-published work by Prof. Andrew
Gelman and his colleagues: [“Bayesian
Workflow”](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/Bayesian_Workflow_article.pdf).
Also, be sure to read his blog post and the comments in response on the
topic: [“Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science:
Bayesian
Workflow”](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/11/10/bayesian-workflow/).
